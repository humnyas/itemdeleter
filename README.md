### About

**Item Deleter** is a Minecraft mod which allows pack creators to delete items from the game.

Despite similar packs of this nature, this mod is easy to configure - you just have to add a list of the items you want to delete from the game, and choose where you want them deleted from - loot tables, mob drops, recipe viewers, etc.

### How to use

To use the mod, find the `config/` folder in your modpacks directory (or use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu))

In the config, there is a list of strings, where you can add the identifiers (modid:moditem) for the items you want deleted.

Optionally, you can turn off its removal in specific places, however it will all be enabled by default.

## Compatibility

This mod should work alongside **every** mod, ergo "modpack creators dream". All you need to know is the identifier (modid:moditem) of the item you want to remove.

Please report bugs, compatibility issues, or suggestions via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/humnyas/itemdeleter-1.21.1-1.20.1/issues).
